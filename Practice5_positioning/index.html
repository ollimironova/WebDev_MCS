					<h2 class="sectionHeader">Mindful Eating</h2>
					<p class="mainText">Mindfulness has become as buzzworthy as cold pressed coffee. One simple way to eat healthier may be to simply be mindful when eating. <br>
					And guess what, mindful eating doesn’t mean dieting or restrictions. It’s about taking a moment to take it in. <br>
					There are a lot of methods out there, but we’ve simplified it for you.<br>
					Ponder: Before you eat, ask yourself, “Am I really hungry?” Sometimes we think we’re hungry when we’re actually thirsty or bored or stressed. Check in, do you need nourishment in the form of food or do you need something else?<br>
					Appraise: When your food is in front of you, take a moment.  How does it look? How does it smell? Do you really want it? Is it more than you need?<br>
					Slow: Slow down, like waaay down. Put your fork down between bites. Really chew your food and taste it. Slowing down helps your brain catch up with your stomach.<br>
					Savor: Really enjoy your food. How does the texture feel in your mouth? What are all the complex flavors you can taste? Take a moment to savor the satisfaction of each bite.<br>
					Stop: Stop when you’re full. Sounds so obvious, right? But hey, cleaning your plate isn’t necessary. By noticing when you’re full and stopping, you may avoid unnecessary calories and indigestion.</p>

					<h2 class="sectionHeader">5 Easy Ways to Find Healthier Options at the Grocery Store</h2>
					<p class="mainText">Want to make smart food choices but confused by all the health claims, messages and logos on foods? Use these tips to avoid the brain strain. 
					</p>
					<ol class="mainText">
						<li>Read food labels, even for so-called “healthier” foods. Ingredients and nutrient content can vary a lot by brand and preparation. When there’s more than one choice, compare labels. Choose the item with the lowest amounts of sodium, saturated fat, trans fat and added sugars.</li>
						<li>Beware of sneaky ingredients. For example, sodium and added sugars go by many different names, making it harder to tell just how much is in there. </li>
						<li>Choose frozen, canned or dried produce when fresh isn’t available or practical. It can be just as nutritious as fresh, and will last longer. Choose canned fruit packed in water, light syrup or its own juice. With canned and frozen vegetables, choose the product with the lowest amount of sodium. Heavy syrups and sauces can add unwanted ingredients to your healthy fruits and veggies.</li>
						<li>Choose whole-grain foods. Lots of products claim to be, but there’s a simple way to know for sure. Look for the word “whole-grain” (or “whole” followed by the grain name) as the first item in the ingredients list. And we’re talking more than just bread. Include crackers, cereals, tortillas, pasta and other grain foods in your whole-grain quest.</li>
						<li>Look for the Heart-Check mark to quickly and easily identify foods that can be part of an overall healthy eating plan. When it’s on the label, you know the product has been certified by the American Heart Association to meet specific science-based nutrition requirements. The Heart-Check is easy to spot and takes some of the guesswork out of comparing Nutrition Facts label information.</li>
